# Caching-on-the-World-Wide-Web-
Simulation on WWW caching for mobile clients
I had to build a simulation for caching on WWW. Files sizes are distributed with zipf's law ( Zipfian Distributed ). The algorithm i used for cache replacement policy is S-LRU. The cache size i simulated is 1-5% of the total size of the files.
